An example of this can be seen in the north-east corner near the city of Recife (use the controls found when hovering the chart to zoom in). Here there is one tile with an average review that’s considerably higher than the surrounding and it’s neighbor tile to the south-east, right next to it, has an average review, lower than the surroundings, so a very high local difference.

So why are the customers less satisfied the in the less dense areas? From previously, we know that it’s closely connected with the delivery – its actual length and how much it was delayed.

But if we look at the group of the 8 states with the lowest average review scores, they all have very low adoption rate as well, except for Rio de Janeiro of course.

We can see here that Rio de Janeiro have quite low delivery times compared with the other low-review-score states, this could be part of the reason behind the high adoption rate. We can also see that a State like Rondonia, that had low adoption rate but high average review scores (the opposite of Rio de Janeiro) has high delivery times, which could explain why it has such low adoption rate. So, for both Rio de Janeiro and Rondonia, the delivery times offer explanations for their high and low adoption rates when seen in relation to the average review scores. Rio de Janeiro has low review scores so they should have a low adoption rate, but they don’t because they also have a short delivery time, and vise versa with Rondonia that has high average review scores, so they should have a high adoption rate, but don’t because of their long delivery times.

")]),t("div",{staticClass:"block"},[e._v(" To conclude we see that we have the highest adoption rates in urban areas and lowest in rural areas. We also have higher average review scores in urban areas compared to rural, so if we accept that we can use the average reviews scores as a proxy for the customer satisfaction, it makes sense that we have higher adoption rates where the customer satisfaction is high. We can also see that there is a good chance that much of this difference in customer satisfaction and hence adoption rates, has to do with the delivery. There is an overall pattern with high average review scores in the urban central part of the country and lower average review scores in the more rural areas in the north. This overall pattern can probably partly be explained by the delivery time that follows the same pattern with much longer delivery times in the north compared to the central part of the country. There are outliers however, that don’t follow this pattern between the delivery time and the average review scores, meaning that they can have a high delivery time but still have a high average review score, often these can, at least in part, be explained by the delays. So if an area has a high average review score and long delivery times it’s often because it also has large negative delays. There also seems to be a pattern where the adoption rate is mostly explained by the length of the delivery times whereas the review scores are more explained by the delay. So, if a state, unusually, has a high review score but a low adoption rate, it’s often because it has a long delivery time but also high negative delays (the items arrive faster than expected). This is for example the case for a state like Rondonia. This actually makes a lot of sense, as what the customer sees when making the decision about purchasing is the estimated delivery time (which is closely correlated with the delivery time) hence the high adoption/purchase rate in areas where this is low. Whereas the delay has more of an effect after the purchase has been made and therefore expresses itself in the average review score. Of course a delay also negatively effects the returning customer rate, so there are cross effect, but the dataset has a short time span and only shows a single purchase per customer, so we don’t see these.

The “band” of state going diagonally downward towards the lower right corner does have some width or leftover variance and it can be seen that this leftover variance is well explained by the delivery time that’s used for coloring the marks. An example is São Paulo, that is to the right of the diagonal, meaning that it has a higher rating than it’s delay dictates, looking at the delivery time however we can also see that this is unusually short. The opposite example can be found with the state of Para, that is placed to the left of the point cloud, meaning that it has a lower average review score than it’s delay would dictate, looking at the delivery time of Para we can see that it’s 23.2 days, which is also unusually high explaining the low raiting.
